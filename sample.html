 and other man-made waste gas vents <br>give off about 23 billion tons of<br>
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse<br> gases into the Earth's atmosphere <br>
each year. The amount of CO2 in the air<br> is about 31% more than it was around 1750.<br>
About three-quarter of the CO2 that<br> people have put in the air during the <br>
past 20 years are due to burning fossil <br>fuel like coal or oil. The rest mostly<br>
comes from changesin how land is used,<br> like cutting down trees.</font></td>

sunspot cycle. The change is so small that <br>scientists can barely measure how it affects the temperature of the <br>
Earth. If the sun was causing the Earth to <br>warm up, it would warm both the surface and high up in the air. But <br>
the air in the upper stratosphere is<br> actually getting colder, so scientists do not think changes in the sun have<br>
 much effect. In addition, over hundreds<br> of millions of years, the sun is slowly getting brighter.</font></td>

<td>Dust and dirt in the air may come from natural sources such as volcanos,[10][11] erosion <br>
and meteoric dust. Some of this dirt falls out within a few hours. Some is aerosol, so small <br>
that it could stay in the air for years. The aerosol particles in the atmosphere make the earth<br>
 colder. The effect of dust therefore cancels out some of the effects of greenhouse gases.[12] Even <br>
though humans also put aerosols in the air when they burn coal or oil this only cancels out the<br>
 greenhouse effect of the fuel burning for less than 20 years: the carbon dioxide stays in the<br>
 atmosphere much longer and keeps on warming the earth.[13]</td>

<h1>Some things people are doing because of climate change</h1>
<p>Some people try to stop global warming, usually by burning less fossil fuel. Many people have tried to get countries to emit less greenhouse gases. <br>
The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997. It was meant to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to below their levels in 1990. However, <br>
carbon dioxide levels have continued to rise<br><br>Energy conservation is used to burn less fossil fuel. People can also use energy sources that don't<br>
 burn fossil fuel, like hydrogen, solar panels or electricity from nuclear power or wind power. Or they can prevent the carbon dioxide from getting out <br>
into the atmosphere, which is called carbon capture and storage (CCS).<br><br>People can also change how they live because of any changes that global warming<br>
 will bring. For example, they can go to places where the weather is better, or build walls around cities to keep flood water out. Like the preventive measures, <br>
these things cost money, and rich people and rich countries will be able to change more easily than the poor. Geoengineering is also seen by some as one climate <br>
change mitigation response. For example, a process using nanotechnology has been found to remove carbon dioxide from the air to create ethanol.[14][15][16]<Br><br></p>
<h1>History of climate change science</h1>
<p>cannot leave nearly as easily. He tried to prove that air can absorb the infrared radiation and will be given back to the Earth’s surface. Later in 1859,<br>
 John Tyndall discovered that water vapor and CO2 trap heat waves given by the sun. In 1896, Svante Arrhenius tried to prove that it would take thousands of<br>
 years for the industrial production of CO2 to raise the Earth’s temperature 5-6°C. But throughout the early 20th century many people did not believe this idea <br>
because it was too simple. In the mid 20th century, scientists worked out that there was a 10% increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the 19th century,<br>
 which made it a little bit warmer. It was at this time that people believed the emissions of CO2 would increase exponentially[source?] in the future and the oceans <br>
would absorb any surplus of greenhouse gases. In 1956, Gilbert N. Plass decided that greenhouse gas emissions will have an effect on the Earth’s temperature and <br>
argued that not thinking about GHG emissions would be a mistake. Soon after, scientists studying all different kinds of science began to work together to figure<br>
 out the mystery of GHG emissions and their effects. As technology advanced, it was in the 1980s that there was proof of a rise in CO2 levels. An ice core, captured <br>
through drilling, provided clear evidence that carbon dioxide levels have risen.[17]></p>

<h1>Effects of global warming on sea levels</h1>
<p>Global warming means that Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets are melting and the oceans are expanding. Recent climate change would still cause a 6 meters<br>
 (20 ft) sea-level rise even if greenhouse gas emissions were reduced in 2015 per a scientific paper in Science.[18][19]<br>Low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, Florida, <br>
the Netherlands and other areas face massive flooding.[20][21]</p>
<h1>Cities affected by current sea level rise</h1>
<p>Many cities are sea ports and under threat of flooding if the present sea level rises.
These and the other cities have either started trying to deal with rising sea level and related storm surge, or are discussing this, according to reliable sources.<br></p>
